            "The show today is totally different, I thought we needed a momement here to take it all in, recharge before we soldier on again, 2016 wasn't easy for a lot of people, yes, there were a lot of highs, but equally a lot of lows, let's take a minute
            here to relax, to think about what we are set out to do in this world and this is mainly to understand each other, even with all our differences, because at the end of the day this is what makes us special and unique, we must learn to accept one
            another and lift others along the way, I will let the music do the talking, it says it all, until next time, close your eyes and fly!"
